Docker uses host network to container with no network isolation.

Host mode networking can be useful to optimize performance, and in situations where a container needs to handle a large range of ports, as it does not require network address translation (NAT), and no “userland-proxy” is created for each port.

We can take an example to deploy application like nginx which uses 80 port by default on the Docker host machine.

Note: 
1)Other applications running on Docker host already listen on 80, nginx container need to be customized to listen on different port number
2)host network works only on Linux machines

Start a container to run on detach mode (run in background)

docker container run -d --rm --network host --name test-nginx nginx
